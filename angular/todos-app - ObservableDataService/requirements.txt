We will be creating an full-stack SPA (single page application) for school management.

Backend: 
You know what todo: We will be creating Create, read, delete for Schools and Students.
.NET REST API
Student can only belong to a single school. School can have lots of students.

Frontend:
Would like to have a everything in a single page:
Split page into 2 parts:
Left:
List of schools (with 'create school' form under)
Right:
List of students  (with 'create student' form under)

Requirements:
1. Be able to delete schools (and students which belong to the school)
2. When creating a student, you must assign a school to the student. 
Try doing front-end validation. (if/Else is ok)
3. Application should look ok (with bootstrap)

if Everything is completed, do this: https://trello.com/b/Ly4QaNwt/devbridge-squares
