We will be creating an application for shop.

The shop will be similar to the warehouse project we have developed before.
It will include Buy functionality;

The Shop will be for ShopItem.
Prices will be Integers;
The shop sells the following items:
Name		Price(in Euros)		Quantity
Ice cream	2					4
Candy		1					4
Apple pie	3					4

We will have a single Buyer who has 10 euros

We should have the following commands:

'Buy Ice cream 5' -> It should allow buying ice cream if Buyer has enough money and enough stock. 
Buy command should update the quantity.
The last number will be quantity.

'Show balance' -> display how much money the users has.

'List items' -> display items with updated quantities. It should not list items which have quantity 0.


Non functional requirements:
We should have classes: ShopItem.cs, Shop.cs (optional -> Buyer.cs)
